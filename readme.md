## About this test

This repository was created for an interview test

These are the questions.

1) In PHP write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 75. For multiples of three print “Hello” instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print “World”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “HelloWorld”.

2) In PHP write a program which compares two arrays and prints the values which are in one but not both arrays. For example given [1,2,3,4,5] and [1,2,3,0,5] the program would print “4” and “0”.
